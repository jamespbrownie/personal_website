        <p>
            I grew up in Mount Vernon, NY but I live in Austin, TX for its sunny weather and access to outdoor activites. I love bicycles, bouldering, gardening, and ambient music. In January 2022 I graduated Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp, and I'm currently looking for my first job in the industry! Feel free to reach out and say hi :-)
